        <p> It turns out this website is hosted somewhere, but not anywhere in particular. 
        This blog is hosted on IPFS, and can only be found through IPFS. 
        And no IPFS is not some new fancy cloud provider. Well not really anyway. 
        See IPFS is short for the Interplanatery File System, 
        and it doesn't hosts files on a single computer in some random sever farm, but rather it hosts files everywhere. 
        IPFS has split up this file in block sized peices and spreads it out to many different computers in the IPFS network. 
        Bob, Eve, Joe, John and maybe even you are helping host this file. 
        Which is nice, because I don't have much spare cash to pay a cloud provider for hosting. </p>
