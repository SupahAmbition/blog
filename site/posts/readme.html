            <p> Hello? What! You're not suppose to know about this place. How did you even get here? 
            This website isn't even hosted anywhere. Nevermind that, since you are here you might as well read 
            <a href="../index.html">these</a>. I like to write about stuff. Nothing weird. 
            Usually just things that I have personal experiance with, such as dual-booting, golang, ipfs, vim, and more. 
            As you can tell I'm a bit of a computer nerd, but don't worry, anyone should be able to follow along.
            If a person has something to say, and no one can understand, did they really say anything?  
            Some of my posts are going to be tutorial-like where I describe steps to complete some task,
            but other posts will be about certain topics that I want to talk about such as
            <a href="./simplicity.html">the importance of simplicity</a>. 

            <p>Oh! One more thing before you go. While yes, technically other people can come here and read what I write, but
            I'm not neccessarly writing for a specific audience. Most of the time I write as if I am talking to myself, and 
            for the most part I'm just doing this for myself. So if you don't like what I have to say, I probably don't care.
            However, if you would like to chat about whatever feel free to send mail to tylerbeverley@gmail.com.
